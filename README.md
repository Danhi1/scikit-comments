# scikit-comments

This is a simple scikit-learn classifier which is used to differentiate between negative, positive and neutral amazon review comments.

The data used to train this can be found here: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

Sample code is trained on videogame reviews, but you can train it on any category without changing anything except data.
